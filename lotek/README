2014: improved pulse finder; still called 'findpulsefdbatch' internally,
but source is in file SNRZFindPulse.h/cpp etc.

The 2013 version is available internally as 'findpulsefdbatch_2013_final'

2013_final:
Files here build lotek-plugins.so, which contains FindPulseFDBatch for
use with vamp-alsa-host, and FindPulseFD for use with audacity.  The
code is identical except for packaging.
